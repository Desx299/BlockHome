About the Project

In traditional real estate, processes are often slow, opaque, and reliant on third-party intermediaries. By integrating blockchain and cryptocurrency, we aim to:

	•	Streamline real estate transactions
	•	Increase transparency and security
	•	Enable tokenization of real estate assets for fractional ownership

Our project includes smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and other tools designed to facilitate these goals.

Features

	•	Property Tokenization: Tokenize real estate assets for fractional ownership.
	•	Smart Contracts: Use Ethereum smart contracts to automate and secure transactions.
	•	Decentralized Marketplace: A dApp for buying, selling, and trading real estate assets.
	•	NFT Deeds: Issue NFT-based ownership proofs and property deeds.
	•	Real Estate Analytics: Tools to evaluate property data, including price trends and investment potential.

Technologies

	•	Blockchain: Ethereum, Solidity
	•	Frontend: React, Web3.js
	•	Backend: Node.js, Express
	•	Database: MongoDB or similar for off-chain storage
	•	Testing: Mocha, Chai
	•	Others: IPFS (for storing decentralized files), Oracles (for real-world data)
